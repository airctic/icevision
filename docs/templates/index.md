IceVision is the first agnostic computer vision framework to offer a curated collection with hundreds of high-quality pre-trained models from torchvision, MMLabs, and soon Pytorch Image Models. It orchestrates the end-to-end deep learning workflow allowing to train networks with easy-to-use robust high-performance libraries such as Pytorch-Lightning and Fastai

**IceVision Unique Features:**

- Data curation/cleaning with auto-fix

- Access to an exploratory data analysis dashboard

- Pluggable transforms for better model generalization 

- Access to hundreds of neural net models

- Access to multiple training loop libraries

- Multi-task training to efficiently combine object detection, segmentation, and classification models
