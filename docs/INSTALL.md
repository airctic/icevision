## installation using pip
### **torch**
Depending on what version of cuda driver you'd like to use, you can install different versions of torch builds. If you're not sure which version to choose, we advise to use the current torch default `cuda-10.2`

=== "cuda-10.2"
    ```
    pip install torch==1.10.0+cu102 torchvision==0.11.1+cu102 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
    ```

=== "cuda-11.1"
    ```
    pip install torch==1.10.0+cu113 torchvision==0.11.1+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
    ```
=== "cpu"
    ```
    pip install torch==1.10.0+cpu torchvision==0.11.1+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
    ```

??? note "checking your `torch`-`cuda` version"  
    To see what version of `torch` and `cuda` is installed in your current environment, run:
    ```
    python -c "import torch;print(torch.__version__, torch.version.cuda)"
    ```
    output:
    ```
    1.10.1+cu102 10.2
    ```
    Your installed torch version will determine which version of `mmcv-full` you can install.

### **mmcv-full** *(optional)*

Installing `mmcv-full` is optional, yet it will let you unleash the full potential of `icevision` and allow you to use the large library of models available in `mmdet`, therefore we strongly recommend doing it.

=== "cuda-10.2"
    ```
    pip install mmcv-full==1.3.17 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu102/torch1.10.0/index.html
    pip install mmdet==2.17.0
    ```

=== "cuda-11.1"
    ```
    pip install mmcv-full==1.3.17 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu113/torch1.10.0/index.html
    pip install mmdet==2.17.0
    ```

=== "cpu"
    ```
    pip install mmcv-full==1.3.17 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cpu/torch1.10.0/index.html
    pip install mmdet==2.17.0
    ```


??? "testing `mmcv` installation"
    
    Installing `mmcv-full` can be tricky as it depends on both the exact `torch` and `cuda` version. 
    We highly recommend that you test your installation. You can verify it by executing the following command inside your virtual environment:
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-mmlab/mmcv/master/.dev_scripts/check_installation.py | python -
    ```
    
    &nbsp;
    If everything went fine, you should see something like the following:
    
    ```
    Start checking the installation of mmcv-full ...
    CPU ops were compiled successfully.
    CUDA ops were compiled successfully.
    mmcv-full has been installed successfully.

### **icevision**
Icevision is distributed in 2 different eggs:

- `icevision[all]` - **recommended** - complete icevision package with all dependencies
- `icevision[inference]` - minimal dependencies, useful for deployment or simply parsing and viewing your dataset

we recommend to install the stable release but if you want to use the most recent, bleeding edge version of the library or would like to contribute, here is how to do it: 

- **stable**
```bash
pip install icevision[all]
```

- **bleeding edge**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/airctic/icevision.git@master#egg=icevision[all] --upgrade
```

- **editable mode (*for developers*)**
```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/airctic/icevision.git
cd icevision
pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install
```
??? "installing using different cuda version"
    
    Installing icevision with different cuda version is possible, however it is only 
    recommended for more experienced users.  

    The main constraint here is `mmcv-full` and `torch` versions compatibility. In short, 
    torch is build for a specific cuda driver version, mmcv-full on the other hand is 
    distributed for a specific torch build.  

    To see which mmcv-full wheels are available for which versions of torch, check the 
    table at [mmcv installation guide](https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/installation.html).


!!! note
    running `pip install icevision` will install `icevision[inference]` by default

## installation using conda

The easiest way to install `icevision` with all its dependencies is to use our conda 
`environment.yml` file. Creating a conda environment is considered as a best practice 
because it avoids polluting the default (base) environment, and reduces dependencies 
conflicts.

<div class="termy">
```console
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airctic/icevision/master/environment.yml 
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

</div>
!!! note
    please note that installation may take up to 5 mins.

!!! warning
    using the `environment.yml` works only on cuda-10.2 enabled devices. If your GPU 
    architecture is Ampere or newer, you have to use the pip installation method.



&nbsp;&nbsp;
## troubleshooting

### MMCV is not installing with cuda support
If you are installing MMCV from the wheel like described above and still are having problems with CUDA you will probably have to compile it locally. Do that by running:
```
pip install mmcv-full
```

If you encounter the following error it means you will have to install CUDA manually (the one that comes with conda installation will not do).
```
OSError: CUDA_HOME environment variable is not set. Please set it to your CUDA install root.
```
Try installing it with:
```
sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
```
Check the installation by running:
```
nvcc --version
```

### Error: Failed building wheel for pycocotools
If you encounter the following error, when installation process is building wheel for pycocotools:
```
unable to execute 'gcc': No such file or directory
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
```
Try installing gcc with:
```
sudo apt install gcc
```
Check the installation by running:
```
gcc --version
```
It should return something similar:
```
gcc (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0
Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```
After that try installing icevision again.
