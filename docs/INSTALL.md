    We currently only support Linux/MacOS installations

## A- Installation using pip

### **Option 1:** Installing from pypi repository **[Stable Version]**
 
To install icevision package together with all dependencies:

<div class="termy">
```console
$ pip install icevision[all]
```
</div>

### **Option 2:** Installing an editable package locally **[For Developers]**

!!! info "Note"  
    This method is used by developers who are usually either:

    - actively contributing to `icevision` project by adding new features or fixing bugs, or 

    - creating their own extensions, and making sure that their source code stay in sync with the `icevision` latest version.

Then, clone the repo and install the package:
<div class="termy">
```console
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/airctic/icevision.git
$ cd icevision
$ pip install -e ".[all,dev]"
$ pre-commit install
```
</div>

### **Option 3:** Installing a non-editable package from GitHub:

To install the icevision package from its GitHub repo, run the command here below. This option can be used in Google Colab,
for example, where you might install the icevision latest version (from the `master` branch)

<div class="termy">
```console
$ pip install git+git://github.com/airctic/icevision.git#egg=icevision[all] --upgrade
```
</div>

## B- Installation using conda
Creating a conda environment is considered as a best practice because it avoids polluting the default (base) environment, and reduces dependencies conflicts. Use the following command in order to create a conda environment called **ice**

<div class="termy">
```console
$ conda create -n icevision python=3.8 anaconda
$ conda activate icevision
$ pip install icevision[all]
```
</div>

## C- Fixing the Error: Failed building wheel for pycocotools
If you encounter the **Failed building wheel for pycocotools error** (see screenshoot here below), you can easily fix it by installing  `gcc` from your linux terminal as shown in the following steps:

<div class="termy">
```console
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install gcc
```
</div>
