# Deployment using Streamlit

We provide a nice demo using [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/). 

If streamlit is not already install, run the following command, from the
terminal to install it:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

Simply run the following in your terminal. It should start a demo in
your browser. It will show you one of our trained models as a pet
detector!!

```bash
streamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oke-aditya/mantisshrimp_streamlit/master/app.py
```

You can find the source code of this demo [here](https://github.com/oke-aditya/mantisshrimp_streamlit).

You can also use it as a template when creating your own streamlit apps with mantisshrimp.
